About
==============================

This is a Djnago project I made for a Codecademy project. The following were the requirements

* Build an inventory and sales application using Django
* Develop locally on your machine
* Version control your application with Git and host the repository on GitHub
* Use the command line to manage your application locally and test out queries
* Users can log in, log out, and must be logged in to see the views
* Users can create items for the menu
* Users can add ingredients to the restaurant’s inventory and update their quantities
* Users can add the different recipe requirements for each menu item
* Users can record purchases of menu items (only the ones that are able to be created with what’s in the inventory!)
* Users can view the current inventory, menu items, their ingredients, and a log of all purchases made

A few things I learned were the usage of get_context_data() this was not taught in the course. Using it to generate variables and lists is very important for moving database information. Codeacademy gave us a very good overview on how to use generic forms but, I wanted to see if {{ form }} could be broken down further for more customization and was able to achieve that.

Future Work

The ability to see easily which ingredients are low
Multiple items for transactions
